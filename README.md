# Fraud-detection-classifier
---
In this Notebook we will build a Logistic Regression Model that can classify that if there are Fraud in our Credit card with 93% accuracy performance Using:
- I used Data Cleaning techniques and Preproceesing for Data
- I used under-sampling to get equal features into our two labels in `Class`

## Model Training

In our case we will use LogisticRegression to train our labeled data

## Model Evaluation

- Accuracy Score for Training data and Testing Data
